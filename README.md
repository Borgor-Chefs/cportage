# About

This is an ncurses tool to manage the use flags of Gentoo packages

## Structure

- `keys.py` is a shorthand remapping for keys, some of them don't reflect what is printed on the keyboard
- `display.py` is a wrapper around the `curses.window` of sorts, this is mainly to handle data
- `main.py` is the main script
